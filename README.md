# What is this?
Well it's code for a site: scratch-neon-chi.vercel.app but i'm also using this for some cool stuff!

# Redirected from BlockWave?
The file called "crafter.html" is Minecraft/EaglxrCrxft, that can run in the web!
If you copy the code and load it in jsfiddle/htmlcafe/w3schools or another html runner, then you can run Minecraft in your browser!

You can also DOWNLOAD the file so you have a local copy!
